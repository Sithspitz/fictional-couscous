Dimension Reduction Flow Cytometry Analysis (Nowicka et al 2019 method)
#### UMAP and T-SNE Master Scripts ####

# Background:

These were from the paper by Nowicka et al (F1000).

Adopted for my data - very little alteration.

Can by used alongside J Irish and his MEM analyses.

# Directories:

In the 'culture_exp_testing' folder, contains a script called 'Nowicka et al 2019 Test 1ry 2ry Script.R' which has a method of doing UMAP and cluster analysis.

This script doesn't include annotating clustering and differential expression analysis between clusters.
## The point directly above is covered in the paper and I can come back to it anytime ##
